        <h1 style="letter-spacing: 0.1px;">Hi, I'm <a style="color: #c99065">Sylvia</a>.</h1>
        <p>I'm an undergraduate at Harvard pursuing a B.A. in <a style="color: black; font-weight: bold">computer science</a>. My passion for creating software lies in the intersection of engineering challenges and social, user-oriented impact, in domains as far-reaching as finance, social justice, health, coalition-building, and sociology.</p>
        <p>I'm a member of Harvard's Women in Computer Science group, Google Women Techmakers, and Rewriting the Code Fellowship, which provide the opportunity to mentor, learn from, and advocate for fellow women in tech.</p>
        <p>I love running and compete on the Harvard cross-country and track team! I'm also passionate about sustainability and women + gender studies and occassionally write on these topics.</p>
