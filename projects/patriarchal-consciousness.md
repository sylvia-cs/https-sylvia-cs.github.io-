title: 'Patriarchal Consciousness: Analysis of the Theory of Exchange in Margaret Atwood’s "The Handmaid’s Tale"'
---

This paper delves into the pioneering feminist theory of Gayle Rubin as a lens to examine the tv adaptation of Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. In particular, I discuss the role of division of labor and the sex/gender system as it manifests in the totalitarian state of Gilead, as well as the nuances of class structure that further contributes to the exchange of women by women themselves.
