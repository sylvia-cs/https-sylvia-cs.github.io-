As a frontend engineer on the Campfire Convos team of the Harvard i-Lab, I collaborated with anther team member to build a new landing page for our online social platform. After designing a theme and corresponding graphics in Figma, we developed a single-page scroll, responsive landing page to help inform and onboard new users.
