In this study, myself and classmate Mari Chen-Fiske undertook research to examine possible correlations between gender and imposter syndrome within the Harvard first-year population. Our survey, modelled off of the Clance IP Scale (developed by Dr. Pauline Rose Clance of Georgia State University) collected data points on imposterism along with anonymized demographic info, such as gender, race, major, income, and other  characteristics. Our research quantified imposterism on a general scale as well as a more granular breakdown within the psychological categories of comparison, competence, fraud, importance, and success. Our results found a consistent trend of higher average self-perception of imposterism among women, which was further magnified for respondees who identified as Black or Native American as well as those in humanities fields. Our full research paper is below.
